"1","ChatUIE: Exploring Chat-based Unified Information Extraction using Large Language Models","Jun Xu, Mengshu Sun, Zhiqiang Zhang, Jun Zhou","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Recent advancements in large language models have shown impressive performance in general chat. However, their domain-specific capabilities, particularly in information extraction, have certain limitations. Extracting structured information from natural language that deviates from known schemas or instructions has proven challenging for previous prompt-based methods. This motivated us to explore domain-specific modeling in chat-based language models as a solution for extracting structured information from natural language. In this paper, we present ChatUIE, an innovative unified information extraction framework built upon ChatGLM. Simultaneously, reinforcement learning is employed to improve and align various tasks that involve confusing and limited samples. Furthermore, we integrate generation constraints to address the issue of generating elements that are not present in the input. Our experimental results demonstrate that ChatUIE can significantly improve the performance of information extraction with a slight decrease in chatting ability.","Fri, 8 Mar 2024 07:59:19 UTC (1,379 KB)"
"2","Secure Information Embedding and Extraction in Forensic 3D Fingerprinting","Canran Wang, Jinwen Wang, Mi Zhou, Vinh Pham, Senyue Hao, Chao Zhou, Ning Zhang, Netanel Raviv","Cryptography and Security (cs.CR)","The prevalence of 3D printing poses a significant risk to public safety, as any individual with internet access and a commodity printer is able to produce untraceable firearms, keys, counterfeit products, etc. To aid government authorities in combating these new security threats, several approaches have been taken to tag 3D-prints with identifying information. Known as fingerprints, this information is written into the object using various bit embedding techniques; examples include varying the height of the molten thermoplastic layers, and depositing metallic powder with different magnetic properties. Yet, the practicality of theses techniques in real-world forensic settings is hindered by the adversarial nature of this problem. That is, the 3D-printing process is out of reach of any law enforcement agencies; it is the adversary who controls all aspects of printing and possesses the printed object. To combat these threats, law enforcement agencies can regulate the manufacturing of 3D printers, on which they may enforce a fingerprinting scheme, and collect adversarially tampered remains (e.g., fragments of a broken 3D-printed firearm) during forensic investigation. Therefore, it is important to devise fingerprinting techniques so that the fingerprint could be extracted even if printing is carried out by the adversary. To this end, we present SIDE (Secure Information Embedding and Extraction), a fingerprinting framework that tackles the adversarial nature of forensic fingerprinting in 3D prints by offering both secure information embedding and secure information extraction.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 22:03:46 UTC (37,378 KB)"

Given the labor-intensive nature of traditional qualitative analysis methods, such as coding, there exists a significant demand for tools that can facilitate the analysis process. Our research investigates various topic modeling techniques and concludes that the best model for analyzing interview texts is a combination of BERT embeddings and HDBSCAN clustering. We present a user-friendly software prototype that enables researchers, including those without programming skills, to efficiently process and visualize the thematic structure of interview data. This tool not only facilitates the initial stages of qualitative analysis but also offers insights into the interconnectedness of topics revealed, thereby enhancing the depth of qualitative analysis.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 13:53:03 UTC (901 KB)"

Mycroft, Marco Barbieri, Magdalena Stobińska","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Accurate phase estimation in the presence of unknown phase diffusive noise is a crucial yet challenging task in noisy quantum metrology. This problem is particularly interesting due to the detrimental impact of the associated noise. Here, we investigate the joint estimation of phase and phase diffusion using generalized Holland-Burnett states, known for their experimental accessibility. These states provide performance close to the optimal state in single-parameter phase estimation, even in the presence of photon losses. We adopt a twofold approach by analyzing the joint information extraction through the double homodyne measurement and the joint information availability across all probe states. Through our analysis, we find that the highest sensitivities are obtained by using states created by directing all input photons into one port of a balanced beam splitter. Furthermore, we infer that good levels of sensitivity persist even in the presence of moderate photon losses, illustrating the remarkable resilience of our probe states under lossy conditions.","Thu, 7 Mar 2024 18:18:34 UTC (331 KB)"

"6","Kernel Correlation-Dissimilarity for Multiple Kernel k-Means Clustering","Rina Su, Yu Guo, Caiying Wu, Qiyu Jin, Tieyong Zeng","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","The main objective of the Multiple Kernel k-Means (MKKM) algorithm is to extract non-linear information and achieve optimal clustering by optimizing base kernel matrices. Current methods enhance information diversity and reduce redundancy by exploiting interdependencies among multiple kernels based on correlations or dissimilarities. Nevertheless, relying solely on a single metric, such as correlation or dissimilarity, to define kernel relationships introduces bias and incomplete characterization. Consequently, this limitation hinders efficient information extraction, ultimately compromising clustering performance. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel method that systematically integrates both kernel correlation and dissimilarity. Our approach comprehensively captures kernel relationships, facilitating more efficient classification information extraction and improving clustering performance. By emphasizing the coherence between kernel correlation and dissimilarity, our method offers a more objective and transparent strategy for extracting non-linear information and significantly improving clustering precision, supported by theoretical rationale. We assess the performance of our algorithm on 13 challenging benchmark datasets, demonstrating its superiority over contemporary state-of-the-art MKKM techniques.","Wed, 6 Mar 2024 04:24:43 UTC (110 KB)"

Preum","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Document-Level Event Argument Extraction (DocEAE) is an extremely difficult information extraction problem -- with significant limitations in low-resource cross-domain settings. To address this problem, we introduce Mad Lib Aug (MLA), a novel generative DocEAE data augmentation framework. Our approach leverages the intuition that Mad Libs, which are categorically masked documents used as a part of a popular game, can be generated and solved by LLMs to produce data for DocEAE. Using MLA, we achieve a 2.6-point average improvement in overall F1 score. Moreover, this approach achieves a 3.9 and 5.2 point average increase in zero and few-shot event roles compared to augmentation-free baselines across all experiments.
To better facilitate analysis of cross-domain DocEAE, we additionally introduce a new metric, Role-Depth F1 (RDF1), which uses statistical depth to identify roles in the target domain which are semantic outliers with respect to roles observed in the source domain. Our experiments show that MLA augmentation can boost RDF1 performance by an average of 5.85 points compared to non-augmented datasets.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 20:07:42 UTC (9,775 KB)"

Quantum machine learning (QML) leverages the unique capabilities of quantum computing to offer novel perspectives and methodologies for complex data processing and pattern recognition challenges. This paper introduces a novel Quantum Mixed-State Attention Network (QMSAN), which integrates the principles of quantum computing with classical machine learning algorithms, especially self-attention networks, to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness in handling NLP tasks.

However, extracting information from textual rules to convert them to a machine-readable format has been a challenge due to the complexities associated with natural language and the limited resources that can support advanced machine-learning techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce CODE-ACCORD, a unique dataset compiled under the EU Horizon ACCORD project. CODE-ACCORD comprises 862 self-contained sentences extracted from the building regulations of England and Finland. Aligned with our core objective of facilitating information extraction from text for machine-readable rule generation, each sentence was annotated with entities and relations. Entities represent specific components such as ""window"" and ""smoke detectors"", while relations denote semantic associations between these entities, collectively capturing the conveyed ideas in natural language. We manually annotated all the sentences using a group of 12 annotators. Each sentence underwent annotations by multiple annotators and subsequently careful data curation to finalise annotations, ensuring their accuracy and reliability, thereby establishing the dataset as a solid ground truth. CODE-ACCORD offers a rich resource for diverse machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) related tasks in ACC, including text classification, entity recognition and relation extraction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first entity and relation-annotated dataset in compliance checking, which is also publicly available.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 17:21:19 UTC (549 KB)"

However, since it only incorporates information from immediate neighborhood, it lacks the ability to capture long-range and global graph information, leading to unsatisfactory performance on some datasets, particularly on heterophilic graphs. To address this limitation, we propose the Directional Graph Attention Network (DGAT) in this paper. DGAT is able to combine the feature-based attention with the global directional information extracted from the graph topology. To this end, a new class of Laplacian matrices is proposed which can provably reduce the diffusion distance between nodes. Based on the new Laplacian, topology-guided neighbour pruning and edge adding mechanisms are proposed to remove the noisy and capture the helpful long-range neighborhood information. Besides, a global directional attention is designed to enable a topological-aware information propagation. The superiority of the proposed DGAT over the baseline GAT has also been verified through experiments on real-world benchmarks and synthetic data sets. It also outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on 6 out of 7 real-world benchmark datasets.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 10:59:16 UTC (275 KB)"

Numerous datasets have been constructed for various IE tasks, leading to time-consuming and labor-intensive data annotations. Nevertheless, most prevailing methods focus on training task-specific models, while the common knowledge among different IE tasks is not explicitly modeled. Moreover, the same phrase may have inconsistent labels in different tasks, which poses a big challenge for knowledge transfer using a unified model. In this study, we propose a regularization-based transfer learning method for IE (TIE) via an instructed graph decoder. Specifically, we first construct an instruction pool for datasets from all well-known IE tasks, and then present an instructed graph decoder, which decodes various complex structures into a graph uniformly based on corresponding instructions. In this way, the common knowledge shared with existing datasets can be learned and transferred to a new dataset with new labels. Furthermore, to alleviate the label inconsistency problem among various IE tasks, we introduce a task-specific regularization strategy, which does not update the gradients of two tasks with 'opposite direction'.

The narrative and unstructured nature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization. We address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data, according to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate data for three critical subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical impression and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a state-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training is orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical tasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and then learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks such as impression and encounter summary. Moreover, we address, several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long context window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms other popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, and only has a mild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards healthcare digitalization and democratization.

Recent zero-shot classification methods converted the task to other NLP tasks (e.g., textual entailment) and used off-the-shelf models of these NLP tasks to directly perform inference on the test data without using a large amount of IE annotation data. A potentially valuable by-product of these methods is the large-scale silver standard data, i.e., pseudo-labeled data by the off-the-shelf models of other NLP tasks. However, there is no further investigation into the use of these data. In this paper, we propose a new framework, Clean-LaVe, which aims to utilize silver standard data to enhance the zero-shot performance. Clean-LaVe includes four phases: (1) Obtaining silver data; (2) Identifying relatively clean data from silver data; (3) Finetuning the off-the-shelf model using clean data; (4) Inference on the test data. The experimental results show that Clean-LaVe can outperform the baseline by 5% and 6% on TACRED and Wiki80 dataset in the zero-shot relation classification task, and by 3%-7% on Smile (Korean and Polish) in the zero-shot cross-lingual relation classification task, and by 8% on ACE05-E+ in the zero-shot event argument classification task.

Automated protocols for recognizing named entities, the building blocks of recipe text, are of immense value for various applications ranging from information extraction to novel recipe generation. Named entity recognition is a technique for extracting information from unstructured or semi-structured data with known labels. Starting with manually-annotated data of 6,611 ingredient phrases, we created an augmented dataset of 26,445 phrases cumulatively.

Recently, many researchers have concentrated on the nexus between embeddings and a comprehensive theory of semantics and meaning. This often involves decoding the representation of word meanings in Distributional Models into a set of discrete, manually constructed properties such as semantic primitives or features, using neural decoding techniques. Our approach introduces an alternative strategy grounded in linguistic data. We have developed a collection of domain-specific co-occurrence matrices, derived from two sources: a classification of Italian nouns categorized into 4 semantic traits and 20 concrete noun sub-categories, and a list of Italian verbs classified according to their semantic classes. In these matrices, the co-occurrence values for each word are calculated exclusively with a defined set of words pertinent to a particular lexical domain. The resource comprises 21 domain-specific matrices, one comprehensive matrix, and a Graphical User Interface. Our model facilitates the generation of reasoned semantic descriptions of concepts by selecting matrices directly associated with concrete conceptual knowledge, such as a matrix based on location nouns and the concept of animal habitats.

This may result in information loss from corrupted images where the available information is inherently sparse, especially for the scenario of large missing regions. Recent advances in self-attention mechanisms within transformers have led to significant improvements in many computer vision tasks including inpainting. However, limited by the computational costs, existing methods cannot fully exploit the efficacy of long-range modelling capabilities of such models.

Moreover, we propose a Spatially-activated Channel Attention Layer (SCAL), an efficient self-attention mechanism interpreting spatial awareness to model the corrupted image at multiple scales. To further enhance the effectiveness of SCAL, motivated by recent advanced in speech recognition, we introduce a sandwich structure that places feed-forward networks before and after the SCAL module.

However, their performance can be inconsistent when tasked with producing text that adheres to specific structured formats, which is crucial in applications like named entity recognition (NER) or relation extraction (RE). To address this issue, this paper introduces an efficient method, G&O, to enhance their structured text generation capabilities. It breaks the generation into a two-step pipeline: initially, LLMs generate answers in natural language as intermediate responses. Subsequently, LLMs are asked to organize the output into the desired structure, using the intermediate responses as context.

"27","Creating a Fine Grained Entity Type Taxonomy Using LLMs","Michael Gunn, Dohyun Park, Nidhish Kamath","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","In this study, we investigate the potential of GPT-4 and its advanced iteration, GPT-4 Turbo, in autonomously developing a detailed entity type taxonomy. Our objective is to construct a comprehensive taxonomy, starting from a broad classification of entity types - including objects, time, locations, organizations, events, actions, and subjects - similar to existing manually curated taxonomies. This classification is then progressively refined through iterative prompting techniques, leveraging GPT-4's internal knowledge base. The result is an extensive taxonomy comprising over 5000 nuanced entity types, which demonstrates remarkable quality upon subjective evaluation.
We employed a straightforward yet effective prompting strategy, enabling the taxonomy to be dynamically expanded. The practical applications of this detailed taxonomy are diverse and significant. It facilitates the creation of new, more intricate branches through pattern-based combinations and notably enhances information extraction tasks, such as relation extraction and event argument extraction. Our methodology not only introduces an innovative approach to taxonomy creation but also opens new avenues for applying such taxonomies in various computational linguistics and AI-related fields.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 21:32:19 UTC (620 KB)"

However, their effectiveness degrades when symbols are missing or not informative. The reason is that the model may not learn to pay attention to the right correlations/contexts without the help of symbols. We propose a new method to pre-train general code models when symbols are lacking. We observe that in such cases, programs degenerate to something written in a very primitive language. We hence propose to use program analysis to extract contexts a priori (instead of relying on symbols and masked language modeling as in vanilla models). We then leverage a novel attention masking method to only allow the model attending to these contexts, e.g., bi-directional program dependence transitive closures and token co-occurrences. In the meantime, the inherent self-attention mechanism is utilized to learn which of the allowed attentions are more important compared to others. To realize the idea, we enhance the vanilla tokenization and model architecture of a BERT model, construct and utilize attention masks, and introduce a new pre-training algorithm. We pre-train this BERT-like model from scratch, using a dataset of 26 million stripped binary functions with explicit program dependence information extracted by our tool. We apply the model in three downstream tasks: binary similarity, type inference, and malware family classification. Our pre-trained model can improve the SOTAs in these tasks from 53% to 64%, 49% to 60%, and 74% to 94%, respectively. It also substantially outperforms other general pre-training techniques of code understanding models.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 05:13:22 UTC (1,233 KB)"

Although researchers are exploring the use of few-shot information extraction through in-context learning with LLMs, they tend to focus only on using correct or positive examples for demonstration, neglecting the potential value of incorporating incorrect or negative examples into the learning process. In this paper, we present c-ICL, a novel few-shot technique that leverages both correct and incorrect sample constructions to create in-context learning demonstrations. This approach enhances the ability of LLMs to extract entities and relations by utilizing prompts that incorporate not only the positive samples but also the reasoning behind them. This method allows for the identification and correction of potential interface errors. Specifically, our proposed method taps into the inherent contextual information and valuable information in hard negative samples and the nearest positive neighbors to the test and then applies the in-context learning demonstrations based on LLMs. Our experiments on various datasets indicate that c-ICL outperforms previous few-shot in-context learning methods, delivering substantial enhancements in performance across a broad spectrum of related tasks.

It acts as a foundation for most information extraction systems. Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) is an open-ended tabletop fantasy game with its own diverse lore. DnD entities are domain-specific and are thus unrecognizable by even the state-of-the-art off-the-shelf NER systems as the NER systems are trained on general data for pre-defined categories such as: person (PERS), location (LOC), organization (ORG), and miscellaneous (MISC). For meaningful extraction of information from fantasy text, the entities need to be classified into domain-specific entity categories as well as the models be fine-tuned on a domain-relevant corpus. This work uses available lore of monsters in the D&D domain to fine-tune Trankit, which is a prolific NER framework that uses a pre-trained model for NER. Upon this training, the system acquires the ability to extract monster names from relevant domain documents under a novel NER tag.

Opinion-dynamics models have been used to study a variety of phenomena in online social networks, but an open question remains on how these models can be augmented to take into account the fine-grained impact of user-level timeline algorithms. We make progress on this question by providing a way to model the impact of timeline algorithms on opinion dynamics. Specifically, we show how the popular Friedkin--Johnsen opinion-formation model can be augmented based on aggregate information, extracted from timeline data. We use our model to study the problem of minimizing the polarization and disagreement; we assume that we are allowed to make small changes to the users' timeline compositions by strengthening some topics of discussion and penalizing some others. We present a gradient descent-based algorithm for this problem, and show that under realistic parameter settings, our algorithm computes a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximate solution in time $\tilde{O}(m\sqrt{n} \lg(1/\varepsilon))$, where $m$ is the number of edges in the graph and $n$ is the number of vertices. We also present an algorithm that provably computes an $\varepsilon$-approximation of our model in near-linear time. We evaluate our method on real-world data and show that it effectively reduces the polarization and disagreement in the network.

In the field of text-to-image generation (T2I), subject-driven content generation has achieved great progress with the ID in the images controllable. However, extending it to video generation is not well explored. In this work, we propose a simple yet effective subject identity controllable video generation framework, termed Video Custom Diffusion (VCD). With a specified subject ID defined by a few images, VCD reinforces the identity information extraction and injects frame-wise correlation at the initialization stage for stable video outputs with identity preserved to a large extent. To achieve this, we propose three novel components that are essential for high-quality ID preservation: 1) an ID module trained with the cropped identity by prompt-to-segmentation to disentangle the ID information and the background noise for more accurate ID token learning; 2) a text-to-video (T2V) VCD module with 3D Gaussian Noise Prior for better inter-frame consistency and 3) video-to-video (V2V) Face VCD and Tiled VCD modules to deblur the face and upscale the video for higher resolution.
Despite its simplicity, we conducted extensive experiments to verify that VCD is able to generate stable and high-quality videos with better ID over the selected strong baselines. Besides, due to the transferability of the ID module, VCD is also working well with finetuned text-to-image models available publically, further improving its usability.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) like U-Net, have shown remarkable success in medical image segmentation tasks. However, they have limitations in capturing global context and long-range relations, especially for objects with significant variations in shape, scale, and texture. While transformers have achieved state-of-the-art results in natural language processing and image recognition, they face challenges in medical image segmentation due to image locality and translational invariance issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an innovative U-shaped network called BEFUnet, which enhances the fusion of body and edge information for precise medical image segmentation. The BEFUnet comprises three main modules, including a novel Local Cross-Attention Feature (LCAF) fusion module, a novel Double-Level Fusion (DLF) module, and dual-branch encoder. The dual-branch encoder consists of an edge encoder and a body encoder. The edge encoder employs PDC blocks for effective edge information extraction, while the body encoder uses the Swin Transformer to capture semantic information with global attention. The LCAF module efficiently fuses edge and body features by selectively performing local cross-attention on features that are spatially close between the two modalities. This local approach significantly reduces computational complexity compared to global cross-attention while ensuring accurate feature matching. BEFUnet demonstrates superior performance over existing methods across various evaluation metrics on medical image segmentation datasets.","Tue, 13 Feb 2024 21:03:36 UTC (7,083 KB)"

Kinetic proofreading (KPR) is a key mechanism enhancing signaling specificity through time-delayed steps, although its effectiveness is debated due to intrinsic noise potentially reducing signal fidelity. In this study, we reformulate the theory of kinetic proofreading (KPR) by convolving multiple intermediate states into a single state and then define an overall ""processing"" time required to traverse these states. This simplification allows us to succinctly describe kinetic proofreading in terms of a single waiting time parameter, facilitating a more direct evaluation and comparison of KPR performance across different biological contexts such as DNA replication and T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. We find that loss of fidelity for longer proofreading steps relies on the specific strategy of information extraction and show that in the first-passage time (FPT) discrimination strategy, longer proofreading steps can exponentially improve the accuracy of KPR at the cost of speed. Thus, KPR can still be an effective discrimination mechanism in the high noise regime. However, in a product concentration-based discrimination strategy, longer proofreading steps do not necessarily lead to an increase in performance. However, by introducing activation thresholds on product concentrations, can we decompose the product-based strategy into a series of FPT based strategies to better resolve the subtleties of KPR-mediated product discrimination. Our findings underscore the importance of understanding KPR in the context of how information is extracted and processed in the cell.","Wed, 7 Feb 2024 03:05:16 UTC (1,070 KB)"

These models make predictions that fall into a limited number of predefined classes, facilitating a binary true or false evaluation and enabling the direct calculation of metrics such as the F1 score. However, recent advancements in generative large language models (GLLMs) have prompted a shift in the field due to their enhanced zero-shot capabilities, which eliminate the need for a downstream dataset and computationally expensive fine-tuning. However, evaluating GLLMs presents a challenge as the binary true or false evaluation used for discriminative models is not applicable to the predictions made by GLLMs. This paper introduces a new metric for generative models called ANLS* for evaluating a wide variety of tasks, including information extraction and classification tasks. The ANLS* metric extends existing ANLS metrics as a drop-in-replacement and is still compatible with previously reported ANLS scores. An evaluation of 7 different datasets and 3 different GLLMs using the ANLS* metric is also provided, demonstrating the importance of the proposed metric.

On our full corpus of 728 full-text nanobiology articles, containing more than 120k entity occurrences, NanoNER obtained a F1-score of 0.98 on the recognition of previously known entities. Our model also demonstrated its ability to discover new entities in the text, with precision scores ranging from 0.77 to 0.81. Ablation experiments further confirmed this and allowed us to assess the dependency of our approach on the external resources. It highlighted the dependency of the approach to the resource, while also confirming its ability to rediscover up to 30% of the ablated terms. This paper details the methodology employed, experimental design, and key findings, providing valuable insights and directions for future related researches on NER in specialized domain. Furthermore, since our approach require minimal manpower , we believe that it can be generalized to other specialized fields.","Tue, 30 Jan 2024 09:10:53 UTC (69 KB)"

However, the prevailing evaluation pipeline may not be sufficiently robust for assessing the information extraction ability of PTLMs, due to inadequate annotations within the benchmarks. Therefore, we claim the necessary standards for an ideal benchmark to evaluate the information extraction ability of PTLMs. We then introduce EC-FUNSD, an entity-centric benckmark designed for the evaluation of semantic entity recognition and entity linking on visually-rich documents. This dataset contains diverse formats of document layouts and annotations of semantic-driven entities and their relations. Moreover, this dataset disentangles the falsely coupled annotation of segment and entity that arises from the block-level annotation of FUNSD. Experiment results demonstrate that state-of-the-art PTLMs exhibit overfitting tendencies on the prevailing benchmarks, as their performance sharply decrease when the dataset bias is removed.","Sun, 4 Feb 2024 07:33:45 UTC (7,771 KB)"

This paper studies disagreements in expert-annotated named entity datasets for three languages: English, Danish, and Bavarian.

We introduce an innovative approach, called FormNexus, for automated web form test generation, which emphasizes deriving semantic insights from individual form elements and relations among them, utilizing textual content, DOM tree structures, and visual proximity. The insights gathered are transformed into a new conceptual graph, the Form Entity Relation Graph (FERG), which offers machine-friendly semantic information extraction. Leveraging LLMs, FormNexus adopts a feedback-driven mechanism for generating and refining input constraints based on real-time form submission responses. The culmination of this approach is a robust set of test cases, each produced by methodically invalidating constraints, ensuring comprehensive testing scenarios for web forms. This work bridges the existing gap in automated web form testing by intertwining the capabilities of LLMs with advanced semantic inference methods.

However, adapting light field data to enhance Salient Object Detection (SOD) still follows the traditional RGB methods and remains under-explored in the community. Previous approaches predominantly employ a custom two-stream design to discover the implicit angular feature within light field cameras, leading to significant information isolation between different LF representations. In this study, we propose an efficient paradigm (LF Tracy) to address this limitation. We eschew the conventional specialized fusion and decoder architecture for a dual-stream backbone in favor of a unified, single-pipeline approach. This comprises firstly a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy called MixLD to bridge the connection of spatial, depth, and implicit angular information under different LF representations. A highly efficient information aggregation (IA) module is then introduced to boost asymmetric feature-wise information fusion. Owing to this innovative approach, our model surpasses the existing state-of-the-art methods, particularly demonstrating a 23% improvement over previous results on the latest large-scale PKU dataset. By utilizing only 28.9M parameters, the model achieves a 10% increase in accuracy with 3M additional parameters compared to its backbone using RGB images and an 86% rise to its backbone using LF images.

To this end, various methods have been proposed to create an adaptive filter by incorporating an extra filter (e.g., a high-pass filter) extracted from the graph topology. However, these methods heavily rely on topological information and ignore the node attribute space, which severely sacrifices the expressive power of the deep GCNs, especially when dealing with disassortative graphs. In this paper, we propose a cross-space adaptive filter, called CSF, to produce the adaptive-frequency information extracted from both the topology and attribute spaces. Specifically, we first derive a tailored attribute-based high-pass filter that can be interpreted theoretically as a minimizer for semi-supervised kernel ridge regression. Then, we cast the topology-based low-pass filter as a Mercer's kernel within the context of GCNs. This serves as a foundation for combining it with the attribute-based filter to capture the adaptive-frequency information. Finally, we derive the cross-space filter via an effective multiple-kernel learning strategy, which unifies the attribute-based high-pass filter and the topology-based low-pass filter. This helps to address the over-smoothing problem while maintaining effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CSF not only successfully alleviates the over-smoothing problem but also promotes the effectiveness of the node classification task.","Fri, 26 Jan 2024 14:02:29 UTC (3,649 KB)[v2] Sat, 10 Feb 2024 08:58:14 UTC (3,650 KB)"

While fine-tuned MLM-based encoders consistently outperform causal language modeling decoders of comparable size, recent decoder-only large language models (LLMs) perform on par with smaller MLM-based encoders. Although their performance improves with scale, LLMs fall short of achieving state-of-the-art results in information extraction (IE) tasks, many of which are formulated as sequence labeling (SL). We hypothesize that LLMs' poor SL performance stems from causal masking, which prevents the model from attending to tokens on the right of the current token. Yet, how exactly and to what extent LLMs' performance on SL can be improved remains unclear. We explore techniques for improving the SL performance of open LLMs on IE tasks by applying layer-wise removal of the causal mask (CM) during LLM fine-tuning. This approach yields performance gains competitive with state-of-the-art SL models, matching or outperforming the results of CM removal from all blocks.

However, existing benchmarks do not fully assess LLMs' capability in handling real-world, lengthy clinical data.
Methods: We present the LongHealth benchmark, comprising 20 detailed fictional patient cases across various diseases, with each case containing 5,090 to 6,754 words. The benchmark challenges LLMs with 400 multiple-choice questions in three categories: information extraction, negation, and sorting, challenging LLMs to extract and interpret information from large clinical documents.
Results: We evaluated nine open-source LLMs with a minimum of 16,000 tokens and also included OpenAI's proprietary and cost-efficient GPT-3.5 Turbo for comparison. The highest accuracy was observed for Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, particularly in tasks focused on information retrieval from single and multiple patient documents. However, all models struggled significantly in tasks requiring the identification of missing information, highlighting a critical area for improvement in clinical data interpretation.
Conclusion: While LLMs show considerable potential for processing long clinical documents, their current accuracy levels are insufficient for reliable clinical use, especially in scenarios requiring the identification of missing information. The LongHealth benchmark provides a more realistic assessment of LLMs in a healthcare setting and highlights the need for further model refinement for safe and effective clinical application.

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising transfer learning capability. In this study, we explored whether recent LLMs can reduce the need for large-scale data annotations. We curated a manually-labeled dataset of 769 breast cancer pathology reports, labeled with 13 categories, to compare zero-shot classification capability of the GPT-4 model and the GPT-3.5 model with supervised classification performance of three model architectures: random forests classifier, long short-term memory networks with attention (LSTM-Att), and the UCSF-BERT model. Across all 13 tasks, the GPT-4 model performed either significantly better than or as well as the best supervised model, the LSTM-Att model (average macro F1 score of 0.83 vs. 0.75). On tasks with high imbalance between labels, the differences were more prominent. Frequent sources of GPT-4 errors included inferences from multiple samples and complex task design. On complex tasks where large annotated datasets cannot be easily collected, LLMs can reduce the burden of large-scale data labeling. However, if the use of LLMs is prohibitive, the use of simpler supervised models with large annotated datasets can provide comparable results. LLMs demonstrated the potential to speed up the execution of clinical NLP studies by reducing the need for curating large annotated datasets. This may result in an increase in the utilization of NLP-based variables and outcomes in observational clinical studies.","Thu, 25 Jan 2024 02:05:31 UTC (1,483 KB)"

They achieve this by bridging the gap between pre-trained language models and fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. Despite these advancements, the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in information extraction tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER), using prompts or instructions, still falls short of supervised baselines. The reason for this performance gap can be attributed to the fundamental disparity between NER and LLMs. NER is inherently a sequence labeling task, where the model must assign entity-type labels to individual tokens within a sentence. In contrast, LLMs are designed as a text generation task. This distinction between semantic labeling and text generation leads to subpar performance. In this paper, we transform the NER task into a text-generation task that can be readily adapted by LLMs. This involves enhancing source sentences with task-specific instructions and answer choices, allowing for the identification of entities and their types within natural language. We harness the strength of LLMs by integrating supervised learning within them. The goal of this combined strategy is to boost the performance of LLMs in extraction tasks like NER while simultaneously addressing hallucination issues often observed in LLM-generated content.

Previous methods focus on leveraging the correlations between different modalities and enhancing performance through sophisticated fusion techniques. However, challenges still exist due to the inherent heterogeneity of distinct modalities, which may lead to distributional gap, impeding the full exploitation of inter-modal information and resulting in redundancy and impurity in the information extracted from features. To address this problem, we introduce the Multimodal Information Disentanglement (MInD) approach. MInD decomposes the multimodal inputs into a modality-invariant component, a modality-specific component, and a remnant noise component for each modality through a shared encoder and multiple private encoders. The shared encoder aims to explore the shared information and commonality across modalities, while the private encoders are deployed to capture the distinctive information and characteristic features. These representations thus furnish a comprehensive perspective of the multimodal data, facilitating the fusion process instrumental for subsequent prediction tasks. Furthermore, MInD improves the learned representations by explicitly modeling the task-irrelevant noise in an adversarial manner. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets, including CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and UR-Funny, demonstrate MInD's superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods in both multimodal emotion recognition and multimodal humor detection tasks.","Mon, 22 Jan 2024 10:26:52 UTC (1,843 KB)"

We investigate the applicability of transfer learning for enhancing a name tagging model trained in the biomedical domain (the source domain) to be used in the chemical domain (the target domain). A common practice for training such a model in a few-shot learning setting is to pretrain the model on the labeled source data, and then, to finetune it on a hand-full of labeled target examples. In our experiments we observed that such a model is prone to mis-labeling the source entities, which can often appear in the text, as the target entities. To alleviate this problem, we propose a model to transfer the knowledge from the source domain to the target domain, however, at the same time, to project the source entities and target entities into separate regions of the feature space. This diminishes the risk of mis-labeling the source entities as the target entities. Our model consists of two stages: 1) entity grouping in the source domain, which incorporates knowledge from annotated events to establish relations between entities, and 2) entity discrimination in the target domain, which relies on pseudo labeling and contrastive learning to enhance discrimination between the entities in the two domains. We carry out our extensive experiments across three source and three target datasets, and demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines, in some scenarios by 5\% absolute value.","Fri, 19 Jan 2024 03:49:28 UTC (2,114 KB)"

This paper introduces sketch-guided constrained decoding (SGCD), a novel approach to constrained decoding for blackbox LLMs, which operates without access to the logits of the blackbox LLM. SGCD utilizes a locally hosted auxiliary model to refine the output of an unconstrained blackbox LLM, effectively treating this initial output as a ""sketch"" for further elaboration. This approach is complementary to traditional logit-based techniques and enables the application of constrained decoding in settings where full model transparency is unavailable. We demonstrate the efficacy of SGCD through experiments in closed information extraction and constituency parsing, showing how it enhances the utility and flexibility of blackbox LLMs for complex NLP tasks.","Thu, 18 Jan 2024 13:31:24 UTC (2,568 KB)"

"75","UniVIE: A Unified Label Space Approach to Visual Information Extraction from Form-like Documents","Kai Hu, Jiawei Wang, Weihong Lin, Zhuoyao Zhong, Lei Sun, Qiang Huo","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Existing methods for Visual Information Extraction (VIE) from form-like documents typically fragment the process into separate subtasks, such as key information extraction, key-value pair extraction, and choice group extraction. However, these approaches often overlook the hierarchical structure of form documents, including hierarchical key-value pairs and hierarchical choice groups. To address these limitations, we present a new perspective, reframing VIE as a relation prediction problem and unifying labels of different tasks into a single label space. This unified approach allows for the definition of various relation types and effectively tackles hierarchical relationships in form-like documents. In line with this perspective, we present UniVIE, a unified model that addresses the VIE problem comprehensively. UniVIE functions using a coarse-to-fine strategy. It initially generates tree proposals through a tree proposal network, which are subsequently refined into hierarchical trees by a relation decoder module. To enhance the relation prediction capabilities of UniVIE, we incorporate two novel tree constraints into the relation decoder: a tree attention mask and a tree level embedding. Extensive experimental evaluations on both our in-house dataset HierForms and a publicly available dataset SIBR, substantiate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, underscoring the effectiveness and potential of our unified approach in advancing the field of VIE.","Wed, 17 Jan 2024 14:02:36 UTC (5,928 KB)"

In this paper, we proposed a system to construct a probabilistic metric map enriched with object information extracted from the environment from RGB-D images. Our approach combines a state-of-the-art YOLOv8-based object detection framework at the front end and a 2D SLAM method - CartoGrapher at the back end. To effectively track and position semantic object classes extracted from the front-end interface, we employ the innovative BoT-SORT methodology.

Unlike previous research, our approach takes into reliable navigating in the environment with various hollow bottom objects. The output of our system is a probabilistic map, which significantly enhances the map's representation by incorporating object-specific attributes, encompassing class distinctions, accurate positioning, and object heights. A number of experiments have been conducted to evaluate our proposed approach. The results show that the robot can effectively produce augmented semantic maps containing several objects (notably chairs and desks).

We consider an occluded point to be one that is imaged in the reference frame but not in the next. Estimating the motion of these points is extremely difficult, particularly in the two-frame setting. Previous work only used the current frame as the only input, which could not guarantee providing correct global reference information for occluded points, and had problems such as long calculation time and poor accuracy in predicting optical flow at occluded points. To enable both high accuracy and efficiency, We fully mine and utilize the spatiotemporal information provided by the frame pair, design a loopback judgment algorithm to ensure that correct global reference information is obtained, mine multiple necessary global information, and design an efficient refinement module that fuses these global information. Specifically, we propose a YOIO framework, which consists of three main components: an initial flow estimator, a multiple global information extraction module, and a unified refinement module. We demonstrate that optical flow estimates in the occluded regions can be significantly improved in only one iteration without damaging the performance in non-occluded regions. Compared with GMA, the optical flow prediction accuracy of this method in the occluded area is improved by more than 10%, and the occ_out area exceeds 15%, while the calculation time is 27% shorter. This approach, running up to 18.9fps with 436*1024 image resolution, obtains new state-of-the-art results on the challenging Sintel dataset among all published and unpublished approaches that can run in real-time, suggesting a new paradigm for accurate and efficient optical flow estimation.","Thu, 11 Jan 2024 12:37:47 UTC (1,282 KB)"

Neural radiance fields, particularly NeRF, initially developed for static scenes, have spurred the creation of various methods for video view synthesis. However, the challenge for video view synthesis arises from motion blur, a consequence of object or camera movement during exposure, which hinders the precise synthesis of sharp spatio-temporal views. In response, we propose a novel dynamic deblurring NeRF framework for blurry monocular video, called DyBluRF, consisting of an Interleave Ray Refinement (IRR) stage and a Motion Decomposition-based Deblurring (MDD) stage. Our DyBluRF is the first that addresses and handles the novel view synthesis for blurry monocular video. The IRR stage jointly reconstructs dynamic 3D scenes and refines the inaccurate camera pose information to combat imprecise pose information extracted from the given blurry frames. The MDD stage is a novel incremental latent sharp-rays prediction (ILSP) approach for the blurry monocular video frames by decomposing the latent sharp rays into global camera motion and local object motion components. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our DyBluRF outperforms qualitatively and quantitatively the very recent state-of-the-art methods.

Hamid Aghvami","Robotics (cs.RO)","The ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) service of the fifth-generation (5G) mobile communication network struggles to support safe robot operation. Nowadays, the sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication network is proposed to provide hyper-reliable and low-latency communication to enable safer control for robots. However, current 5G/ 6G research mainly focused on improving communication performance, while the robotics community mostly assumed communication to be ideal. To jointly consider communication and robotic control with a focus on the specific robotic task, we propose task-oriented and semantics-aware communication in robotic control (TSRC) to exploit the context of data and its importance in achieving the task at both transmitter and receiver. At the transmitter, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to generate optimal control and command (C&C) data and a proactive repetition scheme (DeepPro) to increase the successful transmission probability. At the receiver, we design the value of information (VoI) and age of information (AoI) based queue ordering mechanism (VA-QOM) to reorganize the queue based on the semantic information extracted from the AoI and the VoI. The simulation results validate that our proposed TSRC framework achieves a 91.5% improvement in the mean square error compared to the traditional unmanned aerial vehicle control framework.","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 16:45:26 UTC (5,454 KB)"

However, manual dataset creation from these resources is challenging due to issues in maintaining quality and consistency, scalability limitations, and the risk of human error and bias. Therefore, in this work, we develop a chemist AI agent, powered by large language models (LLMs), to overcome these challenges by autonomously creating structured datasets from natural language text, ranging from sentences and paragraphs to extensive scientific research articles.

Most recent approaches rely on deep neural networks, which, despite their impressive performance, possess opacity, making it challenging to elucidate their output for a given input. While the issue of interpretability has been emphasized in other fields like medicine, it has not received attention in music-related tasks. In this study, we explored the relevance of interpretability in the context of automatic music tagging. We constructed a workflow that incorporates three different information extraction techniques: a) leveraging symbolic knowledge, b) utilizing auxiliary deep neural networks, and c) employing signal processing to extract perceptual features from audio files. These features were subsequently used to train an interpretable machine-learning model for tag prediction. We conducted experiments on two datasets, namely the MTG-Jamendo dataset and the GTZAN dataset.

It has recently attracted attention due to the collaboration of information-rich images and concise language to precisely express the requirements of target images. Most of the existing composed image retrieval methods follow a supervised learning paradigm to perform training on a costly triplet dataset composed of a reference image, modified text, and a corresponding target image. To alleviate the demand for difficult-to-obtain labeled triplet data, recent methods have introduced zero-shot composed image retrieval (ZS-CIR), which aims to retrieve the target image without the supervision of human-labeled triplets but instead relies on image-text pairs or self-generated triplets. However, these methods are less computationally efficient due to the requirement of training and also less understandable, assuming that the interaction between image and text is conducted with implicit query embedding. In this work, we present a new Training-Free zero-shot Composed Image Retrieval (TFCIR) method which translates the query into explicit human-understandable text. This helps improve computation efficiency while maintaining the generalization of foundation models. Further, we introduce a Local Concept Reranking (LCR) mechanism to focus on discriminative local information extracted from the modified instruction.

Within this context of digital transformation of grocery industry, \textit{Midiadia} is Spanish data provider company that works on converting data from the retailers' products into knowledge with attributes and insights from the product labels, that is, maintaining quality data in a dynamic market with a high dispersion of products. Currently, they manually categorize products (groceries) according to the information extracted directly (text processing) from the product labelling and packaging. This paper introduces a solution to automatically categorize the constantly changing product catalogue into a 3-level food taxonomy.

However, they still exhibit limited capability when facing unknown authentic distortion datasets. To further improve NR-IQA performance, in this paper, a novel supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and Transformer-based NR-IQA model SaTQA is proposed. We first train a model on a large-scale synthetic dataset by SCL (no image subjective score is required) to extract degradation features of images with various distortion types and levels. To further extract distortion information from images, we propose a backbone network incorporating the Multi-Stream Block (MSB) by combining the CNN inductive bias and Transformer long-term dependence modeling capability. Finally, we propose the Patch Attention Block (PAB) to obtain the final distorted image quality score by fusing the degradation features learned from contrastive learning with the perceptual distortion information extracted by the backbone network.

Compared with supervised method, it does not require high-quality human-labelled summaries for training and thus can be easily applied for documents with different types, domains or languages. Most of existing unsupervised methods including TextRank and PACSUM rely on graph-based ranking on sentence centrality. However, this scorer can not be directly applied in end-to-end training, and the positional-related prior assumption is often needed for achieving good summaries. In addition, less attention is paid to length-controllable extractor, where users can decide to summarize texts under particular length constraint. This paper introduces an unsupervised extractive summarization model based on a siamese network, for which we develop a trainable bidirectional prediction objective between the selected summary and the original document. Different from the centrality-based ranking methods, our extractive scorer can be trained in an end-to-end manner, with no other requirement of positional assumption. In addition, we introduce a differentiable length control module by approximating 0-1 knapsack solver for end-to-end length-controllable extracting. Experiments show that our unsupervised method largely outperforms the centrality-based baseline using a same sentence encoder. In terms of length control ability, via our trainable knapsack module, the performance consistently outperforms the strong baseline without utilizing end-to-end training. Human evaluation further evidences that our method performs the best among baselines in terms of relevance and consistency.","Tue, 12 Dec 2023 00:15:26 UTC (3,684 KB)[v2] Mon, 18 Dec 2023 09:05:24 UTC (3,650 KB)"

The state-of-the-art solutions devoted to such a vision-based scheme typically incorporate predefined rules or unsupervised iterative feedback, struggling with multi-fold challenges such as lack of open-source datasets for training the whole pipeline, and the vulnerability to the noises from visual inputs. In response to the dilemma, this paper proposes VisionTraj, the first learning-based model that reconstructs vehicle trajectories from snapshots recorded by road network cameras. Coupled with it, we elaborate on two rational vision-trajectory datasets, which produce extensive trajectory data along with corresponding visual snapshots, enabling supervised vision-trajectory interplay extraction. Following the data creation, based on the results from the off-the-shelf multi-modal vehicle clustering, we first re-formulate the trajectory recovery problem as a generative task and introduce the canonical Transformer as the autoregressive backbone. Then, to identify clustering noises (e.g., false positives) with the bound on the snapshots' spatiotemporal dependencies, a GCN-based soft-denoising module is conducted based on the fine- and coarse-grained Re-ID clusters. Additionally, we harness strong semantic information extracted from the tracklet to provide detailed insights into the vehicle's entry and exit actions during trajectory recovery. The denoising and tracklet components can also act as plug-and-play modules to boost baselines. Experimental results on the two hand-crafted datasets show that the proposed VisionTraj achieves a maximum +11.5% improvement against the sub-best model.","Mon, 11 Dec 2023 14:52:43 UTC (26,855 KB)"

In this paper, we propose an approach that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with human expertise to create an efficient method for generating ground truth labels for medical text annotation. By utilizing LLMs in conjunction with human annotators, we significantly reduce the human annotation burden, enabling the rapid creation of labeled datasets. We rigorously evaluate our method on a medical information extraction task, demonstrating that our approach not only substantially cuts down on human intervention but also maintains high accuracy. The results highlight the potential of using LLMs to improve the utilization of unstructured clinical data, allowing for the swift deployment of tailored NLP solutions in healthcare.","Mon, 4 Dec 2023 19:26:13 UTC (1,137 KB)"

This work revisits the relationship between CNNs and Transformers in lightweight universal networks for medical image segmentation, aiming to integrate the advantages of both worlds at the infrastructure design level. In order to leverage the inductive bias inherent in CNNs, we abstract a Transformer-like lightweight CNNs block (ConvUtr) as the patch embeddings of ViTs, feeding Transformer with denoised, non-redundant and highly condensed semantic information. Moreover, an adaptive Local-Global-Local (LGL) block is introduced to facilitate efficient local-to-global information flow exchange, maximizing Transformer's global context information extraction capabilities. Finally, we build an efficient medical image segmentation model (MobileUtr) based on CNN and Transformer. Extensive experiments on five public medical image datasets with three different modalities demonstrate the superiority of MobileUtr over the state-of-the-art methods, while boasting lighter weights and lower computational cost.

Thus, a number of large language models (LLMs) and automated benchmarks have recently been proposed with the aim of facilitating information extraction in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) using natural language as a tool for mediating in human-AI interaction. The most representative benchmarks are limited to either multiple-choice or long-form answers and are available only in English. In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present a new dataset which, unlike previous work: (i) includes not only explanatory arguments for the correct answer, but also arguments to reason why the incorrect answers are not correct; (ii) the explanations are written originally by medical doctors to answer questions from the Spanish Residency Medical Exams. Furthermore, this new benchmark allows us to setup a novel extractive task which consists of identifying the explanation of the correct answer written by medical doctors. An additional benefit of our setting is that we can leverage the extractive QA paradigm to automatically evaluate performance of LLMs without resorting to costly manual evaluation by medical experts. Comprehensive experimentation with language models for Spanish shows that sometimes multilingual models fare better than monolingual ones, even outperforming models which have been adapted to the medical domain. Furthermore, results across the monolingual models are mixed, with supposedly smaller and inferior models performing competitively. In any case, the obtained results show that our novel dataset and approach can be an effective technique to help medical practitioners in identifying relevant evidence-based explanations for medical questions.","Fri, 1 Dec 2023 13:22:35 UTC (316 KB)"

The key contributions of SparseDC are two-fold. First, we design a simple strategy, called SFFM, to improve the robustness under sparse input by explicitly filling the unstable depth features with stable image features. Second, we propose a two-branch feature embedder to predict both the precise local geometry of regions with available depth values and accurate structures in regions with no depth. The key of the embedder is an uncertainty-based fusion module called UFFM to balance the local and long-term information extracted by CNNs and ViTs.

While data-driven convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show promise in this area, the inherent ambiguity of segmenting object and background boundaries in the task of optic disc and cup segmentation leads to noisy annotations that impact model performance. To address this, we propose an innovative label-denoising method of Multiple Pseudo-labels Noise-aware Network (MPNN) for accurate optic disc and cup segmentation. Specifically, the Multiple Pseudo-labels Generation and Guided Denoising (MPGGD) module generates pseudo-labels by multiple different initialization networks trained on true labels, and the pixel-level consensus information extracted from these pseudo-labels guides to differentiate clean pixels from noisy pixels. The training framework of the MPNN is constructed by a teacher-student architecture to learn segmentation from clean pixels and noisy pixels. Particularly, such a framework adeptly leverages (i) reliable and fundamental insights from clean pixels and (ii) the supplementary knowledge within noisy pixels via multiple perturbation-based unsupervised consistency. Compared to other label-denoising methods, comprehensive experimental results on the RIGA dataset demonstrate our method's excellent performance and significant denoising ability.","Thu, 30 Nov 2023 12:17:16 UTC (1,180 KB)"

The reliability of graph embeddings directly depends on how much the geometry of the continuous space matches the graph structure. Manifolds are mathematical structure that can enable to incorporate in their topological spaces the graph characteristics, and in particular nodes distances. State-of-the-art of manifold-based graph embedding algorithms take advantage of the assumption that the projection on a tangential space of each point in the manifold (corresponding to a node in the graph) would locally resemble a Euclidean space. Although this condition helps in achieving efficient analytical solutions to the embedding problem, it does not represent an adequate set-up to work with modern real life graphs, that are characterized by weighted connections across nodes often computed over sparse datasets with missing records. In this work, we introduce a new class of manifold, named soft manifold, that can solve this situation. In particular, soft manifolds are mathematical structures with spherical symmetry where the tangent spaces to each point are hypocycloids whose shape is defined according to the velocity of information propagation across the data points. Using soft manifolds for graph embedding, we can provide continuous spaces to pursue any task in data analysis over complex datasets. Experimental results on reconstruction tasks on synthetic and real datasets show how the proposed approach enable more accurate and reliable characterization of graphs in continuous spaces with respect to the state-of-the-art.","Wed, 29 Nov 2023 12:48:33 UTC (1,660 KB)"

Results show the contrastive loss in the wav2vec2.0 objective facilitates more effective cross-lingual feature extraction. There is a positive correlation between PSR scores and ASR performance, suggesting that phonetic information extracted by monolingual SSL models can be used for downstream tasks in cross-lingual settings.

Having a system that can effectively extract such information in an interoperable manner would be an asset for several domains, be it finance, health, or legal. Recent developments in natural language processing led to the production of powerful language models that can, to some degree, mimic human intelligence. Such effectiveness raises a pertinent question: Can these models be leveraged for the extraction of structured information? In this work, we address this question by evaluating the capabilities of two state-of-the-art language models -- GPT-3 and GPT-3.5, commonly known as ChatGPT -- in the extraction of narrative entities, namely events, participants, and temporal expressions. This study is conducted on the Text2Story Lusa dataset, a collection of 119 Portuguese news articles whose annotation framework includes a set of entity structures along with several tags and attribute values. We first select the best prompt template through an ablation study over prompt components that provide varying degrees of information on a subset of documents of the dataset. Subsequently, we use the best templates to evaluate the effectiveness of the models on the remaining documents. The results obtained indicate that GPT models are competitive with out-of-the-box baseline systems, presenting an all-in-one alternative for practitioners with limited resources. By studying the strengths and limitations of these models in the context of information extraction, we offer insights that can guide future improvements and avenues to explore in this field.","Fri, 24 Nov 2023 16:19:04 UTC (214 KB)"

Deep models such as LayoutLM and BROS have been proposed to address this problem and have shown promising results. However, they still require a large amount of field-level annotations for training these models. Other approaches using rule-based methods have also been proposed based on the understanding of the layout and semantics of a form such as geometric position, or type of the fields, etc. In this work, we propose a novel approach, EIGEN (Expert-Informed Joint Learning aGgrEatioN), which combines rule-based methods with deep learning models using data programming approaches to circumvent the requirement of annotation of large amounts of training data. Specifically, EIGEN consolidates weak labels induced from multiple heuristics through generative models and use them along with a small number of annotated labels to jointly train a deep model. In our framework, we propose the use of labeling functions that include incorporating contextual information thus capturing the visual and language context of a word for accurate categorization.

In this paper, we aim to compare three prevailing paradigms for E2ERE using a complex dataset focused on rare diseases involving discontinuous and nested entities. We use the RareDis information extraction dataset to evaluate three competing approaches (for E2ERE): NER $\rightarrow$ RE pipelines, joint sequence to sequence models, and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models. We use comparable state-of-the-art models and best practices for each of these approaches and conduct error analyses to assess their failure modes. Our findings reveal that pipeline models are still the best, while sequence-to-sequence models are not far behind; GPT models with eight times as many parameters are worse than even sequence-to-sequence models and lose to pipeline models by over 10 F1 points. Partial matches and discontinuous entities caused many NER errors contributing to lower overall E2E performances. We also verify these findings on a second E2ERE dataset for chemical-protein interactions. Although generative LM-based methods are more suitable for zero-shot settings, when training data is available, our results show that it is better to work with more conventional models trained and tailored for E2ERE. More innovative methods are needed to marry the best of the both worlds from smaller encoder-decoder pipeline models and the larger GPT models to improve E2ERE. As of now, we see that well designed pipeline models offer substantial performance gains at a lower cost and carbon footprint for E2ERE. Our contribution is also the first to conduct E2ERE for the RareDis dataset.","Wed, 22 Nov 2023 22:52:00 UTC (2,351 KB)"

In this paper, we propose a Transformer-style copy-move forgery detection network named as CMFDFormer, and provide a novel PCSD (Pooled Cube and Strip Distillation) continual learning framework to help CMFDFormer handle new tasks. CMFDFormer consists of a MiT (Mix Transformer) backbone network and a PHD (Pluggable Hybrid Decoder) mask prediction network. The MiT backbone network is a Transformer-style network which is adopted on the basis of comprehensive analyses with CNN-style and MLP-style backbones. The PHD network is constructed based on self-correlation computation, hierarchical feature integration, a multi-scale cycle fully-connected block and a mask reconstruction block. The PHD network is applicable to feature extractors of different styles for hierarchical multi-scale information extraction, achieving comparable performance. Last but not least, we propose a PCSD continual learning framework to improve the forgery detectability and avoid catastrophic forgetting when handling new tasks. Our continual learning framework restricts intermediate features from the PHD network, and takes advantage of both cube pooling and strip pooling. Extensive experiments on publicly available datasets demonstrate the good performance of CMFDFormer and the effectiveness of the PCSD continual learning framework.","Wed, 22 Nov 2023 09:27:46 UTC (2,970 KB)"

However, due to the physical relationships between these climatic variables is advisable to study their joint influence on ET0. The box-counting joint multifractal algorithm describes the relations between variables using relevant information extracted from the data singularities. This work investigated the use of this algorithm to describe the simultaneous behaviour of ET0, calculated by means of Penman-Monteith (PM) equation, and relative humidity (RH) and air temperature (T), influencing on it in the middle zone of the Guadalquivir river valley, Andalusia, southern Spain. The studied cases were grouped according to the fractal dimension values, which were related to their probability of occurrence. The most likely cases were linked to smooth behaviour and weak dependence between variables, both circumstances were detected in the local multifractal analysis. For these cases, the rest of Penman Monteith (PM) equation variables, neither the T nor the RH, seemed to influence on ET0 determination, especially when low T values were involved. By contrast, the least frequent cases were those with variables showing high fluctuations and strong relationship between them. In these situations, when T is low, the ET0 is affected by the rest of PM equation variables. This fact confirmed T as main driver of ET0 because the higher T values the lesser influence of other climate variables on ET0. Joint multifractal analysis shows some limitations when it is applied to large number of variables, the results reported are promising and suggest the convenience of exploring the relationships between ET0 and other climatic variables not considered here with this framework such as wind speed and net radiation.","Sat, 18 Nov 2023 04:31:26 UTC (1,263 KB)"

We investigate the use of GPT models and prompt engineering for knowledge graph construction with the Wikidata knowledge graph to address a similar problem to Open IE, which we call Open Knowledge Extraction (OKE) using an approach we call the Linked Open Knowledge Extractor (LOKE, pronounced like ""Loki""). We consider the entity linking task essential to construction of real world knowledge graphs. We merge the CaRB benchmark scoring approach with data from the TekGen dataset for the LOKE task. We then show that a well engineered prompt, paired with a naive entity linking approach (which we call LOKE-GPT), outperforms AllenAI's OpenIE 4 implementation on the OKE task, although it over-generates triples compared to the reference set due to overall triple scarcity in the TekGen set.

The performance of ICL on these tasks mostly cannot reach half of the state-of-the-art results. To explore the reasons behind this failure, we conduct comprehensive experiments on 18 specification-heavy tasks with various LLMs and identify three primary reasons: inability to specifically understand context, misalignment in task schema comprehension with humans, and inadequate long-text understanding ability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that through fine-tuning, LLMs can achieve decent performance on these tasks, indicating that the failure of ICL is not an inherent flaw of LLMs, but rather a drawback of existing alignment methods that renders LLMs incapable of handling complicated specification-heavy tasks via ICL. To substantiate this, we perform dedicated instruction tuning on LLMs for these tasks and observe a notable improvement.

This work focuses on UE-NER, which aims to estimate uncertainty scores for the NER predictions. Previous uncertainty estimation models often overlook two unique characteristics of NER: the connection between entities (i.e., one entity embedding is learned based on the other ones) and wrong span cases in the entity extraction subtask. Therefore, we propose a Sequential Labeling Posterior Network (SLPN) to estimate uncertainty scores for the extracted entities, considering uncertainty transmitted from other tokens. Moreover, we have defined an evaluation strategy to address the specificity of wrong-span cases. Our SLPN has achieved significant improvements on two datasets, such as a 5.54-point improvement in AUPR on the MIT-Restaurant dataset.","Wed, 15 Nov 2023 06:36:29 UTC (1,156 KB)"
"150","All Data on the Table: Novel Dataset and Benchmark for Cross-Modality Scientific Information Extraction","Yuhan Li, Jian Wu, Zhiwei Yu, Börje F. Karlsson, Wei Shen, Manabu Okumura, Chin-Yew Lin","Computation and Language (cs.CL)","Extracting key information from scientific papers has the potential to help researchers work more efficiently and accelerate the pace of scientific progress. Over the last few years, research on Scientific Information Extraction (SciIE) witnessed the release of several new systems and benchmarks. However, existing paper-focused datasets mostly focus only on specific parts of a manuscript (e.g., abstracts) and are single-modality (i.e., text- or table-only), due to complex processing and expensive annotations. Moreover, core information can be present in either text or tables or across both. To close this gap in data availability and enable cross-modality IE, while alleviating labeling costs, we propose a semi-supervised pipeline for annotating entities in text, as well as entities and relations in tables, in an iterative procedure. Based on this pipeline, we release novel resources for the scientific community, including a high-quality benchmark, a large-scale corpus, and a semi-supervised annotation pipeline. We further report the performance of state-of-the-art IE models on the proposed benchmark dataset, as a baseline. Lastly, we explore the potential capability of large language models such as ChatGPT for the current task. Our new dataset, results, and analysis validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our semi-supervised pipeline, and we discuss its remaining limitations.","Tue, 14 Nov 2023 14:22:47 UTC (3,252 KB)[v2] Wed, 15 Nov 2023 02:57:01 UTC (3,252 KB)[v3] Mon, 18 Dec 2023 04:01:35 UTC (3,129 KB)"
