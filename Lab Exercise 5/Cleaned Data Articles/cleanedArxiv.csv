methods: we present the longhealth benchmark, comprising 20 detailed fictional patient cases across various diseases, with each case containing 5,090 to 6,754 words. the benchmark challenges llms with 400 multiple-choice questions in three categories: information extraction, negation, and sorting, challenging llms to extract and interpret information from large clinical documents.
results: we evaluated nine open-source llms with a minimum of 16,000 tokens and also included openai's proprietary and cost-efficient gpt-3.5 turbo for comparison. the highest accuracy was observed for mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v0.1, particularly in tasks focused on information retrieval from single and multiple patient documents. however, all models struggled significantly in tasks requiring the identification of missing information, highlighting a critical area for improvement in clinical data interpretation.
